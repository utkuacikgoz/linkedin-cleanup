Clean up your LinkedIn from your keyboard: prune connections you no longer
recognise, and pages and people cluttering your feed.

It reads your lists into a fast local list. You pick with `↑` `↓` and `space`,
press `↵`, and it does the clicking for you.

Nothing leaves your machine. No account, no API key — and it never sees or asks
for your LinkedIn password.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkuacikgoz/linkedin-cleanup.git
cd linkedin-cleanup
npm install
```

There are two ways to run it. The **extension** needs no second browser and no
terminal after the build, but only reads your lists for now. The **app** below
is the one that removes and unfollows.

### As a Chrome extension (read-only)

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

Then open `chrome://extensions`, turn on **Developer mode**, choose **Load
unpacked**, and pick `dist/extension`. Click the toolbar icon on any LinkedIn
tab to open the side panel.

It scans your lists into the same kind of local list and keeps your keep list,
in the browser you are already signed in to — no separate profile, no second
login. It cannot yet remove or unfollow: those actions are irreversible, and
they stay in the app below until their selectors have been exercised from the
extension against live pages.

### As a local app


## Use it

**1. Open the browser.**

```bash
npm run chrome
```

A browser window opens on LinkedIn. **Log in there** — just this once, the
session is remembered.

> It is a separate browser profile, not the one you browse with. That is
> required: Chrome refuses to be automated on your normal profile.
> Use `npm run brave` if you prefer Brave.

**2. Start it.**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**3. Open http://localhost:5273** and press `r` to scan.

The first scan of a large network takes a few minutes. It saves as it goes, so
stopping halfway is fine.

**4. Pick people, then press `↵`.**

Move with `↑` `↓`, mark with `space`. Confirm, and it works through your list.

## The three tabs

| Tab | What it cleans |
| --- | --- |
| **Connections** | People you are connected to → removes the connection |
| **Followed pages** | Company pages in your feed → unfollows |
| **People you follow** | People you follow without being connected → unfollows |

Each tab scans separately — press `r` on each one.

## Finding who to remove

- **Type to search** — name, job title, or profile link.
- **Shared** — how many connections you have in common. Pick `0` to find people
  with no overlap with your network at all. Needs the **look up** link in the
  status bar first (a few minutes; LinkedIn only tells us for about 1,000
  people, the rest stay `Unknown`).
- **Looks like a company** — flags profiles that read like a brand or agency.
  It is a guess, so hover the `company?` tag to see why it was flagged.
- **Select all** takes everything currently shown — filter first, then select
  all, then remove.

Filtered to people you share no connections with, three of them marked:

## Keys

| Key | |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` `↓` | Move |
| `space` | Mark / unmark |
| `shift` + `↑` `↓` | Mark a range |
| `a` | Mark everything shown |
| `n` | Clear marks |
| `/` | Search (`esc` to leave) |
| `r` | Rescan |
| `↵` | Act on what you marked |
| `d` | Toggle dry run, in the confirm box |

## Keeping people off the list

Some connections you will never want to remove, and scrolling past them every
time is how mistakes happen. Mark them and press <kbd>w</kbd> — or the **Keep**
button — and they disappear from the list entirely.

The counter in the status bar shows how many you are keeping; **show** switches
to that view, where you can select someone and press <kbd>w</kbd> again to stop
keeping them. There is no remove button in that view.

The keep list is enforced by the app itself, not just hidden in the interface:
anything on it is refused even if a stale page or a scripted call asks for it.
It lives in `~/.incleanup/whitelist.json` and a rescan does not touch it.

## Light or dark

It follows your system by default, which is why it can open dark on a dark
desktop. The **Auto / Light / Dark** button in the header pins it either way,
and the choice is remembered.

## Before you remove people

**Removing a connection cannot be undone.** Getting someone back means sending a
new invite they have to accept. Unfollowing is safe — you can follow again.

Three things protect you:

- **Dry run** (`d` in the confirm box) finds everyone you marked and checks it
  can reach the remove button, without clicking it. Nothing is removed.
- **A log** of every attempt is kept at `~/.incleanup/removals.log`, so you can
  look up anyone you cut by mistake.
- **Limits per run**: 100 removals, 500 unfollows. Roughly 5 seconds each, so
  100 people takes about 8 minutes.

That pause between actions is on purpose. LinkedIn restricts accounts that act
in a steady machine rhythm, so let it take its time.

## If something goes wrong

**"browser not attached"** — the browser from step 1 is closed. Run
`npm run chrome` again.

**"not logged in"** — log in to LinkedIn in that browser window, then reload
the page.

**A scan finds far fewer people than LinkedIn says** — scroll the LinkedIn
connections page yourself for a moment and scan again; LinkedIn sometimes stops
feeding rows.

**Browser errors in the log** — lines like `DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT`, `Failed to
resolve address for stun.l.google.com`, `Selected adapter: Apple M1` or `Trying
to load the allocator multiple times` come from the browser itself, not from
this app. They are harmless, appear on any Chromium, and go to
`~/.incleanup/browser.log` rather than your terminal.

**No tabs, or nothing loads** — the app's server is not running. Start it with
`npm run dev`; the page says so as well.

**Profile photos missing** — they are served through the app itself so blockers
do not drop them. If one still fails, the row shows the person's
initials instead.

**Something says "failed"** — nothing was removed for that person. The message
says what it hit. Rescan (`r`) and try that one again.

## Notes

```bash
npm test              # parsers, page readers and the snapshot store
npm run typecheck
npm run build         # typecheck, build the web app and the extension
npm run build:extension
```

The page readers are tested against fixture markup rather than a live account,
so a change that breaks how a card is read fails locally instead of on your
network.

Screenshots use blurred photos and made-up names — the real lists are full of
real people. `npm run screenshots` regenerates them the same way.

Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to LinkedIn. It drives your own
account, in your own browser, on your own machine.

Automating your own account is your call and your risk — LinkedIn's User
Agreement discourages automated access regardless of intent.

LinkedIn changes these pages often. If scans come back empty or actions start
failing, [docs/internals.md](docs/internals.md) explains how each page is read
and where the selectors live.
